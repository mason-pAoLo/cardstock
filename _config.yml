# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
title: The Shape of Card Games
email: goadrich@hendrix.edu
description: >- 
 Welcome! For the past four years, Iâ€™ve been working with some amazing students to 
 build a card game simulation engine called CardStock, along with a new language 
 for programming card games named RECYCLE. This blog is a culmination and 
 continuation of this research project investigating the structure, dynamics, 
 and mechanics of card games.
baseurl: "/cardstock" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
