description: Welcome! For the past four years, Iâ€™ve been working with some amazing
  students to  build a card game simulation engine called CardStock, along with a
  new language  for programming card games named RECYCLE. This blog is a culmination
  and  continuation of this research project investigating the structure, dynamics,  and
  mechanics of card games.
