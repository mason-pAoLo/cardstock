Before we get to the Hearts variants I promised, I realized I needed to spend some time 
thinking carefully about how 
to better visually compare and contrast the games I discuss. If you recall, here's the 
lead history graph for Hearts that I generated
for the [last post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-03-15-hearts-heuristics %}).

While I think these lead history graphs are fascinating, it appears they were a bit overwhelming 
and messy for others.
I also found it hard to clearly communicate in writing what I was seeing in them. 

So, today I'm introducing a new graph, the *average trend*, built from averaging the 
lead histories for each rank. 

### Average Trend Graph

To make the average trend graph, first, I determined the 
order of players based on their final game rank. Then, for each rank, I averaged across the 100
games to find the average trend.

Here's a graph of Hearts showing the average trend for the winning player in Hearts. Lightly in the background, 
I have drawn the full 100 lead histories for the first-place player, and the thick red line shows
the average of the first-place lead estimates. The wild variation up and down, based on 
the rosy view each player takes of their own chances when selecting a move, is smoothed
out in this graph.

We can also see some interesting subtleties in this graph that were missed before. 
The small plateau jumps toward the end of the game, those correspond to the lead player's turn 
for the last 4-5 tricks of the game. So, it looks like the winning player is more likely to
be the lead player near the end of the game, especially when they are following the **Shoot
the Moon** strategy! And while each individual graph varies, we can say now that on average
the winner knows they will win after 3/4 of the game has been played.

Similarly, we can graph the average trend for the losing player, as shown in blue below for the
fourth-place average trend graph.  Note that their final average at the end of the game
is not 0, total loss, since there are games when they might be tied with another player,
such that two players earn 13 points. Or, when the winner shoots the moon, the other 
players will tie for second.

The graph below shows the average trends for the aggregate 
lead histories in Hearts. When we put them all together, I think it is easier to follow the
game flow for each player.

We can quickly see that the fourth-place player drops off 
right away. By the end of the 3rd trick, this fourth-place player will probably 
have a sense that they are losing the game, while the rank estimates of the other three players stay 
tightly clumped until about half-way through. It also looks like the second-place player is likely
to tie with the winner about 40% of the time!

### New Insights on Old Games

We can't let Hearts have all the fun though! Let's go back and look at each of the games
we previously analyzed and see if anything new pops out.

#### Agram

First up, we see below the average trend for 
[Agram]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-03-agram-heuristics %}), our super-simple 
trick-taking game where the winner of the last trick wins the game.

![Agram Average Trend]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/agram/agram-trends-fixed.png){:class="post-image"}

With just 6 tricks in the whole game, there's little time to have strategy in Agram, but this new graph
shows us one piece I missed before. There is a increase in the winning trend at the start of the 
4th trick! This uptick repeats at the start of the 5th trick, and continues on for the final trick.
This says that there is an advantage to being in the lead near the end of the game, so you
can have better control as you try to win the final trick.

#### Pairs

For [Pairs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-04-pairs-heuristics %}), a quick 
press-your-luck game, we previously saw a trend
of the winner of slowly increasing their chances, but weren't sure about the other players. Below is the 
new average trend graph for Pairs.

![Pairs Average Trend]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/pairs/pairs-trends-fixed.png){:class="post-image"}

We can still see the clear slow increase of the winner, but look below! 
Wow! The third and fourth-place players are close for much of the game, only diverging 
at the very end, usually on the last move of the game! This may not be a tense game for 
the winning player, but for the losing player, there are some very critical estimates
and decisions needed for success.

#### Ninety Eight

Our third game was [NinetyEight]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-06-ninetyeight-heuristics %}),
an adding game with straightforward card play. The average trend graph below confirms what
we saw earlier, that most players in the game feel very secure that they will be winning 
the game. 

![NinetyEight Average Trend]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/ninetyeight/ninetyeight-trends-fixed.png){:class="post-image"}

The losing player slowly diverges, but then about half-way through the game, there
is a steep decline. But since we don't know how long the game will take in advance, there is
little the losing player can do to anticipate this sudden turn of events, namely a King 
being placed on the pile and setting the score precariously to 98.

In the 
[No King variant]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-06-ninetyeight-noking %})
of Ninety-Eight, the average trend graph for all players is very steady for much of the game,
as the pile slowly ticks toward 98. 

![NinetyEight No King Average Trend]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/ninetyeight/ninetyeightnoking-trends-fixed.png){:class="post-image"}

Near the end of the game, there is a weird fluctuation of graphs which captures something 
interesting. The losing player's graph, dips, then recovers briefly, then dips completely
down to 0. This is most likely a reflection that there are some cards that can bring the 
pile total back down from 98 once crossed, but their benefit is short-lived.

#### Stealing Bundles

Finally, we revisit 
[Stealing Bundles]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-03-12-bundles-heuristics %}),
a fishing game with simple scoring and matching, but with the potential for large 
point swings.

![Stealing Bundles Average Trend]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/stealingbundles/bundles-trends-fixed.png){:class="post-image"}

Previously, it looked as if the ranks became clear for everyone once the final hand was
dealt, however, the average trend graph tells a slightly different story. Players
now appear to differentiate one by one, first with the winner, then with second place, etc.

### Up Next - Hearts Variants

Hopefully you found this new visualization helpful and as fascinating as I did. I've also updated
all of these graphs on the [Summary]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link leads.md %}) page. Let me know
if there's insights you made that I missed in the comments below.

Now, time for some Hearts variants, to see the effects of small and large rule changes!
