Welcome back to the [CardStock](http://github.com/mgoadric/cardstock) blog! It has been a few years since the last update on [LAMA]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-06-11-lama-heuristics-one %}), so I'll catch you up on what's been happening with the CardStock project.

First, I'm excited that I was able to summarize the analysis of [Hearts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-05-05-hearts-variants %}) in the previous posts into an [academic paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/978-3-031-11488-5_22) for the [Advances in Computer Games 2023](https://icga.org/?page_id=3328) conference.  In this paper, we extended the heuristic discussions a cluster the variants in order to compare directly with the historical evolution of Hearts as described by [David Parlett](https://www.amazon.com/History-Card-Games-David-Parlett/dp/019282905X). You can watch my talk on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/OgupRMyHB9A?t=2896) as part of the General Game Systems session.

Second, this summer I'm excited to be working with [Mason Mason](https://mason-t-demond.github.io/blog/) and [Noah Morris](https://brimstonetrader.github.io/blog/), both rising senior computer science majors at Hendrix, on card game research topics. Mason will be exploring ways to overhaul the simulation engine to increase the speed of playouts in the AI players, while Noah will be comparing and contrasting ReCYCLE and CardStock with [Ludii](https://ludii.games/), a general game playing system for abstract perfect information games. They've both started their own blogs, and will be making updates here about their first games written in ReCYCLE. I'm looking forward to making progress with them!
