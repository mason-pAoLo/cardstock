Stealing Bundles mixed up a repeated deal and matching mechanics, with some
timing and competition for the other player's points. Given our [statistical analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-03-11-bundles-statistics %}),
let's see how it scores on our heuristics of **Fairness, Convergence, Spread, Drama, and Security**. 

(See this previous post for a [review of the heuristics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-11-heuristics %}) I'll be 
discussing.)

#### Fairness = 0.88

With games using just random players, we can determine if Stealing Bundles exhibits some
bias toward the first player, either favorably or unfavorably. And as we have found
for other games, this game is mostly fair. The image below shows that 
random players behave as expected.

However in the four-player game, there is an indication
that the first player will win more often than average. More simulations could help determine
if this is random fluctuations or a true bias.

#### Convergence = 0.51

Since the number of playable cards decreases each round by one, we expect Stealing Bundles
to display some convergence, however, this is tempered by the repeated dealing in the
middle of the game. Here I've added in the regression line for Stealing Bundles to 
our graph of player choices, and it reflects this slight downward compression toward
the end of the game.

#### Spread = 0.14

Do players have interesting choices in Stealing Bundles? The spread for this game is fairly
low, meaning that many of the choices in the game look similar to the player. Below we show
a sample lead history graph for Stealing Bundles from a four-player game with all AI players.
In this game, all players think they are doing reasonably well for most of the game, and estimate
that other players are also doing well, as we can see from the tight band of ranks between
0.4 and 0.7. There is little to distinguish the players until the last fifth of the game
when the ranks are finally settled.

#### Drama = 0.51

We can start to see some trends for the Stealing Bundles when looking at the aggregate lead histories.
First, we see below the lead histories for the four-player games where only one player was an AI, and the
rest were making random decisions. 

![Stealing Bundles One AI Rank Estimate]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/stealingbundles/oneairankestimatewinner.png){:class="post-image"}

There is a clear difference between the first third, 
second third, and final third of the game, which lines up with when new cards are dealt
to the players. In the second third, we see the emergence of players believing they 
can win the game, moving their estimates up to near the top, and this is solidified
in the final third of the game, when all cards have been dealt.

The drama for Stealing Bundles is higher than the other games we have investigated, mostly
due to the uncertainty in the first two-thirds of the game. This trend is born out in 
the games where all players are AI, as shown below. Each player in the game is denoted with 
a different color based on their turn order, red for 1st, green for 2nd, cyan for 3rd, and magenta for 4th.

![Stealing Bundles All AI Rank Estimate]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/stealingbundles/allairankestimate.png){:class="post-image"}

There is a repeating pattern where the players to over-estimate their own success on their 
turn and underestimate everyone else. The peaks in this graph repeat in player order: 
red, green, cyan, magenta, red, green, etc... This could be due to the true distribution of scores 
being much tighter, around 0.75 for each
player, in the early part of the game, but the AI players are picking a statistical outlier
where they look good in comparison to the others. The pattern fades but then picks up again
when players are dealt more cards at the one-third mark. We do not see the pattern reemerge
at the two-third mark though, because by then players are starting to get a better 
estimate of their chances of winning. This pattern also increases the drama of the game,
since other players are consistently underestimating the winner for the first portion of the game.

#### Security = 0.19

With the relative uncertainty for two-thirds of the game, Stealing Bundles has the 
lowest value for Security yet. In the four-player games show below, we can see the winner
becoming clear after the last round of cards are dealt to the players, but 
even then, there remains some movement in the ranks for some games. In other 
runs, the ranks are completely determined by this final card deal, establishing the 
solid bands of rank for first, second, third, and fourth player.

For completeness, here is the three player graph:

![Stealing Bundles All AI Rank Estimate 3p]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/stealingbundles/allairankestimatewinner3p.png){:class="post-image"}

and the two-player graph:

![Stealing Bundles All AI Rank Estimate 2p]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/stealingbundles/allairankestimatewinner2p.png){:class="post-image"}

There appears to be a little more control in the game with less players, as the winner trends 
upward and starts to diverge from the other players starting around 50% of the game for two and three players, 
but is delayed until 60% of the game for four players.

#### Summary

Here is our summary graph of all the heuristics for Stealing Bundles.
Fairness remains high, with a slight convergence. (Convergence might need to be 
recalibrated, as even games with a strong slope appear to be close to 0.5 when scored.)
There is a tight Spread of scores for the AI players, which is related to an increase in Drama, and a decrease
in Security.

#### Up Next - Hearts

Four games in four different genres so far! Our next game will be a return to 
[trick-taking games](https://www.pagat.com/class/trick.html) with the classic 
[Hearts](https://www.pagat.com/reverse/hearts.html). With such a familiar game, I'm hoping to hear from you about your 
questions and hypotheses to explore. There are a large number of variants that we 
can simulate, and hopefully we will see some empirical evidence of their
relative success or failure to add interest to the game play. Please add in what you would like to see
me cover as we survey Hearts in future posts and I'll try to run simulations to 
answer them. Thanks for reading!
